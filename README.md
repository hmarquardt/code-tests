### Code Tests I've Done During Employment Screenings
So when you work on closed source projects, in a work for hire capacity, your Github account looks pretty bare.
It's a common request to see code samples when you're talking with prospective employers.   So for a few I've taken
selected (and sanitized) interesting bits I've collected from my prior employment and made those available privately.

I've also been asked to write code as a test a couple times, that's what we have here.  Given a spec and a tight 
timeline, create code that meets the spec.  So this is where I'll share those, it serves a few use cases:

* It shows how I code under time constraint
* If you're a candidate, it shows the types of things you may one day asked to do.
* If you're an employer, it shows what other companies ask and may give you ideas.

I've done my best to sanitize everything so you can't *obviously* see who the company is, but if you dig you can
probably figure it out.

Generally speaking these have all received high marks from the potential employer, even when they didn't ultimately
end in employment.

In addition to what I've posted here, I also have a few Gists posted that people often miss, so here's a few links:
